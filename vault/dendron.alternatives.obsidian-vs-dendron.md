> Dendron is your IDE for General Knowledge, see how it stacks up vs. Obsidian.

Obsidian is a knowledge base that works on your local Markdown files. 
Unlike Obsidian, Dendron is open source, hierarchically structured and scales with you so can organize (and find) any amount of information.
Additionally, Dendron natively supports multi-vault workspaces so you can separate notes in various contexts and selectively have them open in any combination.

## A Knowledge Base that Scales

## Extensible and open-source

## Multi-vault support

There are times you want to separate the context of the notes you take.

This could be a work-life separation, or a separation between different domains of your interest.

Most tools will allow you to open one workspace at a time, and don't allow links or references to notes outside of the current workspace.

Dendron on the other hand, allows multiple vaults to exist in any number of workspaces you choose to create.
At work, you could have a workspace with only your work-related vault added.
At home, you could have a workspace with only your life-related vault added.
If you wish, you could have a separate workspace that has both, and you can make links and references across these two as if they are in the same vault.

Going further with [[Self Contained Vaults|dendron://dendron.dendron-site/dendron.topic.vaults.self-contained]], a vault could describe another vault as dependant, and Dendron will automatically have the dependent vaults added and up to date for you to reference easily.
