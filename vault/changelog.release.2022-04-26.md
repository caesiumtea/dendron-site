Dendron 0.92 has sprouted  üå±

**Graph View**: We've improved the loading speed of the graph view. You should notice a drastic improvement in load times-up to 100x in larger workspaces üöÄüöÄüöÄ.

**Tree View**: We've improved the stability of the tree view and fixed an error with `Dendron: Rename Note` that caused the tree view to fall out of sync. 

**Self Contained Vaults**: You can now move self contained vaults between local and remote locations using the `Dendron: Vault Convert` command. 

- More information can be found in our [[documentation on vaults|dendron.topic.vaults#convert-vault]]

## Highlights
- enhance(views): optimize graph view load times - 100x improvement on large workspaces
- fix(views): multiple stability fixes for tree view
- enhance(workspace): `vault convert` now works with self contained vaults

## Everything Else
- enhance(workspace): general speed ups across multipel commands
- enhance(workspace): doctor command can detect and fix misconfigured self contained vaults
- fix(pods): exporting as markdown will add `.md` extension to markdown files
- fix(workspace): hovering an asset link while holding `ctrl` no longer opens the asset
- fix(view): some views don't update for new notes with self contained vaults 
- fix(view): broken preview for links with sub-hierarchy starting with .md 
- fix(workspace): remove stale entries from cache when initializing

- ‚≠ê `@codeluggage#5635` shared a link to [a gist on how to setup shortcuts for task management](https://gist.github.com/codeluggage/857b944fc503ff9ff8b20cf6d871943f): _"I've been learning and getting into task management in Dendron lately, and found myself reaching for shortcuts to manage checkboxes. Cobbled together these macros to quickly work with the current line, as well as quickly run through the current file when clearing out old tasks."_
