- [MDN converted to Markdown](https://openwebdocs.org/content/posts/markdown-conversion/)

> In 2021, the Open Web Docs team, with help from Mozilla, the W3C, and the wider web docs community, converted the authoring format for MDN Web Docs - all 11,000 pages of it - from HTML to Markdown.

There's some irony that the central documentation portal for web standards went through a conversion of porting from said web standards (aka HTML) to markdown. 

It also makes sense. While HTML is the markup language of the web, it is not a language that is human friendly. That spot belongs to markdown. 

Love or hate it, markdown occupies the same spot in culture as javascript and JSON - a *universally adopted standard* that has achieved escape velocity and is now pushed forward by its own momentum. 

A general truth that seems obvious but is often overlooked - for something to have mass appeal, it needs to be easy to use. Its not about re-inventing the wheel but meeting people where they are.
